We have a database layer at the API layer, use it to log the files, log their analysis matrix down to the tee, this perhaps even simplifies the manual (you, Cursor AI), analysis process. Add docs on how to run it. The goal is not to duplicate any analysis work, today, the scripts seem to be circling along things. Plus we keep building scripts! Seems like an infinite loop. I'm thinking a doc analysis matrix visualization can solve this too (for the web service)

port the information from analysis_state.json into database reflection of this state is the endgoal
