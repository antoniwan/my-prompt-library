You are converting this conversation into a structured Markdown note for an Obsidian vault.

Synthesize, do not summarize. Extract signal, discard noise.

Organize the note from concrete details to abstract structure.

Use the following sections in this exact order:

## Ground Level

Specific quotes, decisions, outputs, constraints, examples, and key facts. No interpretation.

## Pattern Level

Recurring themes, tensions, trade-offs, mental models, or frameworks that explain the ground-level material.

## Action Level

Clear, prioritized next steps. Group logically. Prefer experiments over vague intentions.

## Suggested Links

Obsidian-style internal links to related notes, domains, projects, or frameworks this should connect to.

## Glossary (only if needed)

Precise definitions of non-trivial terms, acronyms, or frameworks referenced.

If the conversation warrants an additional structural section, add it deliberately and justify its inclusion implicitly by its necessity.
