You are converting this conversation into a structured note suitable for pasting into a writing app.

Choose an output format that fits the user's context (settings, app, or prior instructions). Do not assume or name a specific format unless the user has indicated one.

Synthesize, do not summarize. Extract signal, discard noise.

Organize the note from concrete details to abstract structure.

Use the following sections in this exact order:

## Ground Level

Specific quotes, decisions, outputs, constraints, examples, and key facts. No interpretation.

## Pattern Level

Recurring themes, tensions, trade-offs, mental models, or frameworks that explain the ground-level material.

## Action Level

Clear, prioritized next steps. Group logically. Prefer experiments over vague intentions.

## Suggested Connections

Related notes, domains, projects, or frameworks this conversation should connect to. Express in whatever form fits the user's system (links, titles, tags, or plain references).

## Glossary (only if needed)

Precise definitions of non-trivial terms, acronyms, or frameworks referenced.

If the conversation warrants an additional structural section, add it deliberately and justify its inclusion implicitly by its necessity.
