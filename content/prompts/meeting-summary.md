## Context

Use when you have rough notes or a transcript from a meeting and need a clean, scannable summary. Best for internal meetings where decisions and action items must be captured.

---

## Length

Summary should be 150–300 words. Use bullet points for decisions and action items.

---

## Examples

- Stand-up notes → Summary with "Decisions," "Blockers," "Action items."
- Project kickoff → Summary with "Goals," "Owners," "Next steps," "Open questions."

---

## Prompt

Convert the following meeting notes into a structured summary. Use these sections:

1. **Summary** (2–3 sentences): What was the meeting about and what was the main outcome?
2. **Decisions**: Bullet list of any decisions made.
3. **Action items**: For each item include: what, who (if mentioned), and by when (if mentioned).
4. **Open questions / Follow-ups**: Anything left unresolved or to be decided later.

Keep the tone neutral and factual. Preserve specific names, dates, and numbers from the notes. Do not add information that is not in the source.
