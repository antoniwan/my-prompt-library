## Context

Use when a sales rep needs to send a follow-up email after an initial discovery call or meeting. The tone should be professional, concise, and value-oriented without being pushy.

## Length

Keep the email body to 80–120 words. Subject line under 60 characters.

## Examples

- After a product demo: reference one specific feature they showed interest in.
- After a discovery call: recap one agreed next step and attach any promised materials.

## Prompt

Write a follow-up email after a [type of meeting: discovery call / product demo / introductory call] with [recipient role, e.g. "the Head of Engineering at Acme Corp"]. The email should:

1. Have a clear, specific subject line.
2. Open with a one-sentence reference to the meeting.
3. Include one concrete next step or ask (e.g. scheduling a technical deep-dive, sharing a case study).
4. Close with a single call-to-action and a brief sign-off.

Do not use filler phrases. Keep the tone professional and respectful of their time.
